Task 7 : Stock Market Prediction Analysis Numerical & Textual data (Advanced level). I had 2 types of data files. the textual one was about the news related to market in order to study it and help us in price prediction. and ofcourse the numerical was the prices itself. you can check the dataset.

Steps I followed :


importing libraries


Data wrangling / loading


EDA : Exploring Data + Data cleaning + Analysis & Visualization


Feature Engineering : Data Preprocessing & Ensuring Data is Ready to be implemented in a ML model


Using LSTM approach to build model for numerical data & model evaluation


Using CNN approach to build model for categorical data & model evaluation


Combining these 2 models giving a hybrid deep learning model


I also used news data set, i downloaded it from this website : https://bit.ly/36fFPI6, as it was too large to upload it into github.
